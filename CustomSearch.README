Tested with RT 3.8.2.

CustomSearch allows you to customize the default search and formatting
of the queue views reachable from the "QuickSearch" box in "RT at a
glance".

To use this extension, you need to create to custom fields that both
applies to queues called "CustomSearch" and "CustomFormat". You then
need to enable these under Global/Custom fields/Queues.

When this is done, you can create a custom search for a queue the
usual way. Then click on "Advanced" and copy the values in the "query"
and "format" fields.

Then edit the queue and paste these values into the two custom fields.
When this is done, that search will be used whenever you click on the
queue name in the QuickSearch box.


NOTE: The CustomSearch query is currently appended to the default
query - it does not replace that query.
